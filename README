AVR-RandomStuff
===============

These are some tiny programs I coded to teach myself into electronics
and Atmel AVR microcontrollers. Nothing spectacular, but possibly
useful for someone.

The programs should run on ATmega8, Atmega32U4 and ATmega328P
controllers, if parameters in the Makefile are set appropriate. LED is
always on the upper left side of the controller.

Short description to programs:

led_blink.c - Guess what. A blinking LED. The "Hello World!" of the electronics world.
uart_send_hello.c - The classical "Hello World!" spit out via UART. You'll love it!
uart_echo.c - Get input via UART and echo it. Example for interrupt driven UART I/O.
uart_cmd_shell.c - A tiny command shell. Base for some bigger project I build. Also interrupt driven.

Have fun with it!
